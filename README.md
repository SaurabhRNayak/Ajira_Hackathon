# Ajira_Hackathon
<H3>Simulation model for prototyping a rover communication system via api and testing it on different environment</H3>
<h2>INSTRUCTIONS:</h2>
<h4>1. Run this python file 'rover.py' (required modules: Flask,Json,requests)<br>
2. First run "http://127.0.0.1:5000/" or "http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/environment/configure" on chrome (local host address may vary "http://127.0.0.1:5000" depending on port availability)<br>
3. For adding patch use "http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/environment/patch/<change>" (http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/environment/patch/storm:True or http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/environment/patch/storm:True temperature:40)<br>
4. For getting rover status "http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/rover/status"<br>
5. For getting rover movement  "http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/rover/move/<direction>" (http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/rover/move/up)<br>

A lil bit of modeling by representing rover position on a tabular cordinate is done in html and also the responses are also displayed on the html page for better readability.<br>
Any doubts in the execution contact me via mail-saurabhraman1996@gmail.com or the registered phonenumber given while event registration.<br>
